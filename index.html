        Once upon a time, there was a boy named Bharath who fell deeply in love with a girl named Hema when they were in the 10th grade. However, they never really talked during that time. Fortunately, fate brought them together again in intermediate school, where they found themselves in the same class. They started having light conversations and getting to know each other.

        Then, one day, out of the blue, Hema surprised Bharath by confessing her feelings for him. Overjoyed, Bharath accepted her proposal. Their relationship blossomed, and they began spending a lot of time together. On July 21st, they went to the temple and then enjoyed some delicious ice cream at a nearby shop. Life seemed perfect with Hema by Bharath's side.

        However, one day, Hema suddenly stopped talking to Bharath without any explanation. Concerned and confused, Bharath approached her and asked what the reason was. Hema replied that it was just an attraction and nothing more. This revelation shattered Bharath, leaving him heartbroken. He couldn't understand what had gone wrong.

        As time passed, Bharath moved on with his life, pursuing his engineering degree. But deep inside, he still wondered about the real reason behind Hema's sudden silence. Eventually, he discovered that another girl from their class had spread false rumors about him to Hema. It became clear that neither Bharath nor Hema were at fault; it was merely a misunderstanding caused by misinformation.

        Despite the pain and heartbreak, Bharath cherished the memories of his childhood love for Hema. The story of their love, with its ups and downs, remained etched in his heart as a beautiful and unforgettable chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In the end, Bharath and Hema went their separate ways, without any communication or reconciliation. Though their love story didn't have a fairytale ending, it served as a valuable lesson for Bharath, teaching him the importance of trust, communication, and the impact of misunderstandings in relationships.
